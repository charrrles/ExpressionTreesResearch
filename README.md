# ExpressionTreesResearch

Working with linq expression trees to analyse lambdas passed as arguments. Showcases work with compiling generic expressions.

Context: I was working with a natural language parser to provide a simple query language, and this meant 
that in order to evaluate the results, lambdas had to be built as delegates instead of compiled directly
in code as we normally would in normal c#.
